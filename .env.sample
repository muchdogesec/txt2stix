INPUT_CHARACTER_LIMIT= 50000 # [REQUIRED] keep in mind the token limit for selected model (which includes both input AND output tokens). For example, if your input limit is 50,000 characters, this could incur up to 25,000 tokens. Assuming your selected model allows for 64,000 tokens, you will therefore be able to obtain an output of over 39,000 tokens.
